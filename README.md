# BracketsUTF
One common form of Unicode characters is hexadecimal code, presented as **&#xhhhh;** in HTML.

For the purposes of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm, there are 120 characters classified as 60 pairs of opening and closing paired brackets. This page aims to provide the view of brackets and other similar characters:
* shown in pairs with UTF HEX codes
* searchable from character annotations (ctrl + F)
* can be converted/replaced by each other in different script

The webpage contains hexadecimal coding data of bracket characters from http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/BidiBrackets.txt
